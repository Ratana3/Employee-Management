Instead of generic reports, this allows users to generate custom charts and dashboards tailored to their needs. Examples:

Average hours worked per employee per week.
Turnover rate (how often employees leave and are replaced).
Performance trend graphs (e.g., goal completion over time).
By using interactive dashboards, admins can quickly identify trends and make data-driven decisions.

- Export Data
This feature allows users to save and share reports in different formats:

Excel: For further calculations or data processing.
CSV: A lightweight format compatible with most software.
PDF: Easy to print and present in meetings.
It ensures reports can be accessed offline and shared with stakeholders.

- Audit Trails
An audit trail keeps a record of all admin actions, ensuring accountability and compliance.

Example: If an admin edits an employeeâ€™s attendance record, the system logs:
Who made the change
What was changed
When it happened
This helps prevent fraud and ensures transparency in the system.
